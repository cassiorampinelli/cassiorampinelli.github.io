<div style="text-align: justify">

I am a Civil Engineer with M.Sc. in Environmental Technology and Water Resources from the [University of Brasília](https://unb.br/), Brazil and a specialization in Water Resources from the [Geosciences Institute](https://www.igd.unb.br/) at the University of Brasília. I am currently working on my Ph.D. at [Clarkson University](https://www.clarkson.edu/), USA, under Professor  [Tyler Smith ](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/tyler-smith), focusing on uncertainty analysis in hydrologic modeling. From October 2012 to August 2018, I worked as an infrastructure analyst in the [National Secretariat of Protection and Civil Defense](https://www.gov.br/mdr/pt-br/assuntos/protecao-e-defesa-civil) at the Ministry of National Integration, when I took a license to pursue my Ph.D. One of the main activities of my previous job consisted of analyzing recovering actions in areas affected by natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and droughts.   

My past work experience was at [ENGEVIX Engineering S.A.](http://www.novaparticipacoes.com/en/pagina-inicial-en/), a traditional engineering company in Brazil that provides services in several sectors such as Energy, Oil and Gas, Chemical and Petrochemical and Infrastructure. In this company, I worked as a civil engineer for around 5 years in all phases of designing hydroelectric power plants (Inventory, Feasibility Study, Basic and Detailed Design). The focus of the work consisted of developing hydraulic, hydrologic and reservoir sedimentation studies for designing the main hydraulic structures, such as spillways, intakes, and river diversion structures.

I also worked as an assistant professor at the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering for [IESB](http://www.iesb.br/) and [IESPLAN](http://site.iesplan.br/), two private Brazilian colleges located in Brasília, Brazil.
