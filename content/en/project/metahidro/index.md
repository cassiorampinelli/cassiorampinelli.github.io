*  **(2005-2006) - METAHIDRO - Methodologies for the Treatment of Hydrotechnical Problems in Dam Engineering**

**Objectives:** The project sought to study aspects related to the safety and structural integrity of concrete dams, of particular elements and their components, as well as to deal with Fluid-Structure Dynamic Interaction problems in Dam Engineering. It is also a goal of the project helping with the improvement of dam designing by increasing the knowledge about Brazilian dam`s safety based on real cases simulations of [ELETRONORTE](https://www.eletronorte.gov.br/) dam's park.

**Project Members:**

* Coordination: Lineu José Pedroso

* Participants: Cássio Guilherme Rampinelli;André Nascimento Barbosa; Paulo Marcelo Vieira Ribeiro; Rita de Cássia Silva;Thiago Soares Arima; Eurice Souza;Carlos Eduardo Veras Neves;Selênio Feio da Silva;Carlos Augusto Elias Melo.

**Funding:** Centrais Elétricas do Norte do Brasil -[ELETRONORTE](https://www.eletronorte.gov.br/)

**Products:** Technical reports and papers for the improvement of dam designing by increasing the knowledge about Brazilian dam safety based on real cases simulations of ELETRONORTE dam's park.
