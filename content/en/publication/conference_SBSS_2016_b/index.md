abstract: This work presents an evaluation of the effects of non-conventional drainage measures in reducing the design flood of the stormwater drainage system designed for Alto da Boa Vista residential condominium, located in Sobradinho, Distrito Federal. Among the measures evaluated are - maximum impervious index for the lots areas, concrete blocks paving and dug boxes for each residential unit. These measures are part of the rules for use e land occupation in the condominium and were taken into consideration in the drainage system project for the area. With regard to the mentioned measures, different scenarios were simulated allowing the assessment of the effects of single and combined measures in the designed hydrographs at the outlet of the modeled system. Simulations were carried out using the SWMM- Storm Water Management Model, developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency - EPA. Previous studies were used as reference to the parameter calibration procedure. The outcomes indicate reduction up to 60% in the designed pick flow at the outlet of the modeled basin for the most favorable scenario that considers the maximum impervious index measure.
