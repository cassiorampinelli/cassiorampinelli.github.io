abstract: The use of photovoltaic solar energy as an option to supplement electricity generation has grown significantly in Brazil. However, the number of residential and commercial facilities that effectively use this type of system is still small against the potential that the country has to this energy source. In this context, in order to contribute to the development of the discussion of this issue, this study presents a study of alternatives for the implementation of a power generation system from solar photovoltaics connected to the distribution network (on the grid) for a commercial unit of large consumption. Besides the presentation of the system, the design methodology is an analysis of four system configuration alternatives, which differ in numbers of panels adopted, in order to support the definition of the best option for the case study. The four scenarios are compared to the lifetime of the system, considering- the estimated costs of implementation and maintenance of systems, the electricity generated, the monthly value reduction in the energy bill, the internal rate and the return time investment, as well as the present value. It also took into account in the comparisons the possibility of funding for the completion of the initial investment, checking his reflection in the internal rate of return and time. The results indicated the feasibility of system implementation, even with making financing more attractive, to the scenario that uses the least amount of panels.
