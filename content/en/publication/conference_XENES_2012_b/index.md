abstract: This work covers the diversion channel of the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Complex, which links the two reservoirs formed by the undertaking. The first one is produced by the main dam in the Pimental site, where the spillway and the secondary power house are. Connecting the main reservoir to the second one there is a diversion channel about 20 km long, on which this work focus. The channel has reaches with varied widths and bottom elevations throughout its length. The second reservoir is limited by dikes and dams along its extension and located between the channel and the Belo Monte site, where the main power house is. In order to investigate the sedimentological dynamics in the channel, a one-dimension mathematical model was adopted- HEC-RAS (version 4.1.0), developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USA). The channel was modeled apart, however, the upstream and downstream contour conditions were considered so that they were able to represent hydraulically the existence of the reservoirs in both sites as regards hydraulics and sedimentology. As a result, it was observed that there is not risk of erosion nor silting in the channel along the time interval modeled (100 years), then rendering the undertaking feasible.
