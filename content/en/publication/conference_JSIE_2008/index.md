abstract: The study of transient flows in forced conduits is important for security in projects of penstock systems. The quantification of flow parameters such as pressure, velocity and frequencies of oscillations are aspects of interest for sizing tubular structures covered by fluid under pressure. Failure to consider these parameters could lead to serious accidents and a large amount of damage. The present work describes the results of numerical simulations using basic java routines to study transient flows, based on the solutions of the classic conservation equations (mass and momentum). The implemented routines were structuralized to allow some interaction with users. The result is a simple program that will calculate velocity and pressure in specific sections of one tubing for four boundary conditions. To facilitate the structure of the routines, they were divided into packages and classes. The results were compared with previously documented cases.
