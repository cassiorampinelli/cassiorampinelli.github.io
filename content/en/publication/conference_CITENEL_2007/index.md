abstract: This work  presents a synthesis of previously carried out studies related to transient flows in water pipes. Results obtained from developed computational routines will be confronted with cases from the literature and previous simulations from the literature. Effects on flows arising from valve closures, changes in diameters and situations inducing transits will be analyzed. The cases were simulated with the aid of the TRANSPETRO program and some computational routines still in implementation phase, allowing the verification of pressure and velocity along the pipeline. The analyzes carried with the implemented numerical methods in Java routines when compared to outputs from the TRANSPETRO software corresponded to expected trends.
